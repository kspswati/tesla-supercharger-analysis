# Tesla Supercharger Network Analysis

A comprehensive data analytics project exploring Tesla's global Supercharger infrastructure using Python, pandas, seaborn, and geospatial techniques. This project investigates deployment patterns, charging power trends, elevation impacts, and regional disparities to generate actionable business insights.

---

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to uncover patterns in Teslaâ€™s Supercharger network by analyzing its station-level attributes â€” including location, power output, stall count, elevation, and open dates. The goal is to generate insights that can support infrastructure planning, expansion strategies, and customer experience optimization.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information for each Tesla Supercharger location, such as:

- `Supercharger`: Station name/identifier  
- `Street Address`, `City`, `State`, `Country`, `Zip`: Location details  
- `Stalls`: Number of available charging points  
- `kW`: Charging power capacity  
- `Elev(m)`: Elevation above sea level  
- `GPS`: Latitude and Longitude  
- `Open Date`: Commissioning date of the station

## ðŸ“Š Analytics Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, converted data types, parsed GPS coordinates  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted `Latitude`, `Longitude`, and `Year`  
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summary statistics, frequency distributions  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmaps for numeric features  
- **Visualization**: Time-series trends, scatter plots, bar plots, KDE plots  
- **Business Interpretation**: Translated patterns into actionable insights

## Summary of Key Findings and Business Insights

### ðŸ“ˆ 1. Supercharger Power Output Has Increased Over Time

- Newer stations (post-2019) show a jump from ~150 kW to 250 kW.  
- Older stations (pre-2018) generally offer slower charging speeds.  

**Business Insight:** Tesla is investing in faster charging to enhance user experience.  
**Actionable Value:** Prioritize upgrading older stations in high-traffic areas.

---

### 2. U.S., China, and Germany Lead in Deployment

- These countries dominate in total station count.  
- Reflects alignment with mature EV markets.  

**Business Insight:** EV infrastructure follows demand growth.  
**Actionable Value:** Expand into emerging EV regions (e.g., Eastern Europe, SE Asia).

---

### 3. Only ~5.7% of Stations Exist at High Elevations (>1000m)

- Most stations are in low-elevation areas.  

**Business Insight:** High-elevation builds may be logistically or economically challenging.  
**Actionable Value:** Develop destination-based infrastructure (mountain towns, scenic routes).

---

### âš¡ 4. High-Power Stations Tend to Have More Stalls

- 250 kW stations often have 40+ stalls, unlike lower-kW stations which typically have <20.  

**Business Insight:** Tesla scales speed and capacity together.  
**Actionable Value:** Optimize site selection for large hubs in dense traffic corridors.

---

### 5. Supercharger Growth Accelerated Post-2015

- Major expansion in station deployment occurred between 2015â€“2022.  

**Business Insight:** Reflects increased EV adoption and brand expansion.  
**Actionable Value:** Use vehicle sales trends to predict and plan future station needs.
